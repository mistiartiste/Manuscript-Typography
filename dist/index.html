                    <p class="font-small">A man of women. As fourth in a family of seven siblings my ‘father’ had only managed to bring women into the world. A son of my mother I became the heir who he had so much desired and when the fruit of his loins had consistently remained that of the fairer sex he accepted the wise men’s saying ‘Heri nusu shari kuliko shari kamili’. As I lay on my back wet with sweat as the day dawned my mind was drawn back to the day I made acquaintance with this man as a grin tugged the corners of my mouth.
                        I was 8 years at the time and my mother had arranged to have me meet a man who she was planning to discuss certain matters with and she thought that I would enjoy spending an evening his daughter who was also my age. I should have known that this ‘talk’ was so much more than the usual talk- it was written all over her face.  As we sauntered into his yard he met us with a pleasant expression on his face and a warm glow in his eyes. After a warm exchange between my mom and himself he knelt and looked kindly into my eyes. “I’m Amale Jafari on a safari. And you?”

                <p>“Daddy, who is this you have brought today?” a feminine soprano yet tomboy voice questioned with glee. “This is Reiki,” her dad responded looking at her expectantly. “Oh! So I am now expected to tell him my name. Oh! Alright. I am Ciara,” she responded grabbing my hand and shaking it overenthusiastically. Her father could barely hide his amused expression and my mom was clearly pleasantly surprised. “Where are Aaliyah and Binta,” Amale speculated. “Right here, dad, a meter or two behind the coach” Ciara responded almost telepathically. She hadn’t even looked behind her!</p>

                <p>Halfway down the stairs up to the front door to the house she stopped nearly causing me to plummet down the steps. “Call me Chiamaka, Ciara is just so drab for me,” she mouthed almost in a whisper. After a brief nod from me she proceeded, “So, you are Reiki. Do you have another name?” “Rapondi,” I responded matching her tone. “Perfect I didn’t like Reiki all that much. But Rapondi…” she persisted repeating my name like a well-seasoned sommelier sampling well aged wine. “I love it…” she completed.</p>

                <p>With one fluid motion she leapt down the stairs shouting back up the stairs for me to catch her if I could. One who loves a good challenge I took off after her and managed to tag her then took off towards the cow shed. I was greeted with the characteristic mooing of docile cows when disturbed in the middle of a well-earned chomping. As I looked about for the perfect place to hide myself my left foot squelched into some warm gooey substance. I thanked the ancestors that I was barefooted. Upon hearing the footfalls of Chiamaka all interest towards my foot dissolved and I took off out of the shed through the other end. Little did I know that was the end she had chosen to enter through. Though pleasantly surprised at the ease with which I had made my getting caught she deftly headed towards me primed to tag me.
                    Well let’s simply say the unexpected happened. As her outstretched hand sook to grab me I skidded right out her reach on the warm gooey substance which I immediately observed to be freshly defecated cow dung. Well soon after that Chiamaka had it really easy and she cherished the moment slowly but determinedly tagging me. After firmly and completely wiping the cow fecal matter from my foot I got back into the tango this time determined to make light work of Chiamaka.

                <p>“Rapondi, you stink,” Chiamaka began. “You don’t smell like a flower yourself Chiamaka. A man is his sweat. Or so they say. As if she had not heard what I had said she continued, “Time to get you cleaned up.” She then proceeded to splash the cold water on me. The cool stream came both as a shock and relief to me- from the hot scalding noon day sun. Jumping right into a shallow part of the pond in my shorts I cupped my hands and sent torrents of water upon Chiamaka one after the other. 
                    She deftly avoided a couple of torrents of water- but the water found its mark, well, at least sufficiently to make her wet- and returned the sentiment. The war was on. At a point a grabbed a frog and threw right at her face. Shrieking in a mixture of shock, fear and glee she batted the thoroughly displeased animal while it was still in the air leaving her to my attacks that left her from breast to waist soaking wet. Not one to be put down easily she retaliated frisking the water with her hands in swift repetitive motion that she sent a thin wave of water on me from head to toe. A few minutes later we were very clearly hence called in a truce- for the moment- and stopped our tango.

                <p>Breathing deeply- and heavily at that we lay on the the riverbed a few inches from each other our legs submerged completely in the cool river water. The sun once oppressive now sent its warm rays on my body caressing my flesh and vaporizing the water on my clothes. However, something just wasn’t alright. I couldn’t quite my finger on it though. Chiamaka’s body had gone stiff and upon turning my body to have a better view of her she had a long face and a faraway expression that betrayed her desolation.
                    “Why the long face?” I asked genuinely concerned. “You just won’t understand.” “Try me,” was my almost instant reply.
                    “Here goes. My sisters are practically twice my age- 15 and 16- and they treat me like I am some kind of annoying critter that has crawled from under a rock. Anything I attempt to say they look at me so pathetically I want to throw my guts all over the carpet. They say ‘You are just young, darling, when you grow up you will understand,’” mimicking them in a purry cat-like voice.  </p>

                <p> “Chike, you are absolutely correct. Our culture holds some messed up ideologies. However, like a butterfly priming itself to fly we have shed off archaic and inhuman traditions. The Cut has been one the last to go,” Amale began. “It is not yet gone Jafari. It cleaves to us still!” My mom interjected sharply her voice set on edge from her agitation. “True we have been slow to shed the tradition but to deviate a moment from the topic at hand, the practice itself was made by women as a way by which to tame their salacity. Thus women are the best candidates to tame this beast.” Amale contemplatively proceeded. “However, to whose benefit and pleasure is it for?” My mom retorted. “It is often done to the benefit of the man in order that he may be able to have as many wives as he so desires. For it has been often repeated that two-or more- uncut women are vipers bidding their time waiting to strike. However, it is to no party’s pleasure since a cut woman is harder to arouse and she cannot reach the level of arousal of her uncut counterpart- hence her orgasmic pleasure is greatly inhibited. Not to mention this severely inhibits the pleasure that either party reaps from the sexual experience.”</p>

                <p>“Do you want to bail out on our love now, Jafari?” Chike teased.
                    “Nothing can bring our love to dissolution,” Amale responded hugging Chike in a way that I felt excessively overenthusiastic. “But culture cannot permit this union- our ethnicities Chike.” “Why should I care for a culture that does not feed me? All it has meted me is pain, sorrow and heartbreak. If culture shall frown upon this union then let for I do not care. Let your people call me a gold digger and whatever derogatory word they can form with their lips but I shall be unmoved. My people already perceive your culture as shrouded in the dark arts of the underworld and barbarism but I do not care.” Chike emotively uttered.
                    In a loving near whisper Amale mouthed, “Neither do I. If we stand alone then our love will be the fire that warms us in the coldest night. But shall we continue to love in darkness…”

                <p>We were well and clearly caught and we knew it. Chiamaka and I scampered away towards the plant gardens some five hundred meters away. Breathing deeply we fell onto the soft grass that made up the ground in the plant gardens. Lying side by side our heaving bodies inches from each we let out childish giggles and chuckles that were muffled by the foliage. “That was a close one,” I voice in the middle of breathing and laughing, “we should be more careful next time.” “Or find a way to get my snobbish sisters out of the picture,” she replied her sweet expression suddenly turning petulant. </p>

                <p>She was deeply interested in exotic botanical studies- though I am yet to understand this concept of botany she was consumed by- and decided to engage in a Japanese art of cultivation she mentioned was called Bonsai. The purpose was to grow plants in pots for years while constantly pruning them to prevent them growing too large. She placed one such plant at the location that that tree currently stands and we went on holiday. The vacation took so much longer than expected and since the gardener was unaware of that tree it grew shockingly fast. Upon our arrival it was quite massive- considering its previous size- and mom decided to shape it into the shape of a heart in commemoration of my mom’s and dad’s love.

Those were the most awkward three seconds of my life. Ayana and Binta looked completely disgusted while Amale and mom stared in utter disbelief. I reasoned in my mind that if I also spat my saliva would shield me from hers making it less gross. Spitting with decisive zest I held out my hand to hers.
                    As if on cue she initiated motion towards mine and we met in the middle of the distance between us. Three firm shakes later we had officially sealed our friendship.
